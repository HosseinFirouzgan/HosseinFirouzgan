# 👋 Hi, I'm Hossein!

**Backend Developer in Training**  
I’m on a quest to become a backend engineer and master the fine art of writing code that works on the first try (haha, just kidding).

## 🛠️ My Trusty Tools

- **Languages**: Python (my main squeeze), JavaScript (the necessary evil), HTML, CSS  
- **Frameworks**: Django (because reinventing the wheel is for superheroes)  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (it stores my data *and* my regrets)  
- **Tools & Services**: Git (for undoing my mistakes), Docker, Redis, Celery, RabbitMQ (basically a bunch of tools I pretend to fully understand)

## 🎯 My Non-Coding Life

When I'm not summoning errors in my code, you’ll find me:

- 📈 **Studying Economics** – because numbers are less scary when they don’t throw exceptions.  
- 🎬 **Watching Movies** – where the only bugs are plot holes.  
- 🎮 **Gaming** – where my debugging skills finally pay off.  
- 🎧 **Listening to Music** – because coding in silence is for robots.

Let's connect and build something awesome (and hopefully bug-free)! 🚀  
Or at least let’s pretend we know what we’re doing.
